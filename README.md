# StuctProgLang
this final project I am comparing the following in c++ and python
1. recurrsion
2. parameter passing
3. dynamic memory

What I really noticed between the two was that for recurssion in both were actually pretty similar other than some general structure. then with paramter passing I saw that python was very different. I found that python doesnt use pass by value or refernce like c++ and that it uses pass by object reference instead. so for example instead of passing values or references to memory locations it passes a reference to an object that has values or several values then you could refernce each of the values indivdually. Lastly I found that dynamic memory is very differnt in the two. With c++ the programmer has to memory manage themselves and make sure they delete things, but in python the programmer doesnt have to worry about it and the language does it all for you. so I was able to fill an array of whatever size with random numbers very easily without having to create an actually dynamic array with the new keyword like I did in c++. I also didnt have to delete the array becasue ot gets deleted by the system after its no longer in use
This is what i have come to find in the difference between the three things in these two languages !
